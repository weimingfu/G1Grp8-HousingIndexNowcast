    "text": "Motivation\n\nSingapore’s housing market distinguishes itself by operating under a dual-market structure that includes a public segment developed by the Housing Development Board (HDB), subject to strict government rules and regulations, and a private segment where market dynamics exclusively dictate prices. Government-regulated HDB flats, which constitute approximately 73% of residential units, accommodate 80% of Singapore’s populace, according to The Economist (2017). The government sets the prices for new HDB apartments, offering them to citizens at subsidized rates. While the resale prices of HDB apartments are not directly managed, they are significantly shaped by governmental policies, which are periodically modified in response to the country’s macroeconomic challenges (Chan et al., 2012). Despite the smaller scale of the private property sector, our analysis focuses on this segment due to its dynamics being less influenced by governmental control and more by market forces. Our study focuses on accurately and promptly predicting changes in private housing prices, a critical tool for homebuyers, sellers, investors, and policymakers."

    "section": " Problem",
    "text": "Problem\n\nForecasting Singapore’s private housing index is beset with difficulties, arising from the complex interplay among several factors such as economic indicators, employment trends, policy changes, and current market sentiments. The intricacy is further intensified by the delayed nature of crucial indices and indicators, which are commonly released with a substantial time delay, usually spanning from one to three months. These delays impede the capacity to accurately predict private house price changes, as the most up-to-date data required for precise forecasts is not easily accessible.\nTo tackle this problem, it is necessary to utlilise nowcasting models that can precisely forecast the future direction of the Singapore private housing market. The objective is to utilize these models to provide stakeholders, including homebuyers, sellers, investors, and policy makers, with timely and convenient access to predictive data via visual analytics."

    "text": "Current Literature\n\nTaniyama (2013) pioneers the use of real-time data, such as news articles and internet search queries, to forecast real estate market trends. By quantifying market sentiment and public interest obtained from these digital sources, the study presents an innovative approach for analyzing the present state of the housing market, demonstrating that immediate digital footprints might be effective indicators of market dynamics..\nHousing Price Prediction Using Neural Networks (2014) research employs artificial neural network (ANN) models to predict public housing prices in Singapore. The study is divided into two sections: the first uses static ANN to estimate selling prices based on housing characteristics, and the second uses dynamic ANN to predict the trend of the resale price index, incorporating nine independent economic and demographic variables.\nHousing Price Prediction Using Deep Learning (2022) advances the field by comparing deep learning methods against traditional machine learning algorithms for forecasting the housing resale price index in Singapore. By integrating both historical housing data and macroeconomic indicators, this research evaluates the effectiveness of various models, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and others, in capturing the complex patterns of price movements, thereby offering a more nuanced understanding of predictive performance in the housing market."
